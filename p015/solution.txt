The paths on a 2x2 grid can be described by
0 = right
1 = down

The enumeration of all possible paths are

0011, 0101, 0110,
1001, 1010, 1100

It follows that all possible paths on a twenty by twenty grid are

1111111111111111111100000000000000000000
through
0000000000000000000011111111111111111111

The formula to determine the number of paths is
40!/(20!*20!)
